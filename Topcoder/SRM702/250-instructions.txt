Problem Statement
    
Recently, Alice had to take a test. The test consisted of a sequence of true/false questions. Alice was completely unprepared for the test, so she just guessed each answer.
You are given the following inputs:
an integer questions: the number of questions on the test.
an integer guessed: the number of questions for which Alice guessed that the answer is "true".
an integer actual: the actual number of questions for which the answer is "true".
In the test, each correct answer was worth 1 point and each incorrect answer was worth 0 points. Compute the largest possible number of points Alice could have received.

Returns: 2
The test consisted of 3 statements.
Alice guessed that 1 of them is true.
Actually, there were 2 true statements on the test.
There are multiple possible outcomes of the test.
For example, it is possible that Alice wrote down the sequence of answers (false,true,false), but the correct sequence of answers is (true,false,true). In this case Alice would have received 0 points.
One possible best scenario for Alice looks as follows: Alice guessed that the answers are (false,false,true), and the correct answers are (true,false,true). In this scenario Alice would have received 0+1+1 = 2 points.
